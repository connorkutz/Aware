						Our project, Aware, is an android app designed to improve pedestrian awareness and eliminate the disconnect between headphone users and the outside world. We do this by providing an interface that allows the user to hear alerts through their headphones in the event of nearby criminal activity and dangerous noise alerts. We can provide alerts for users walking into areas of high crime density, alerts when there is a crime reported nearby, and alerts for dangerous noises detected, such as gunshots. With all of this, users can create an account to store and sync thier settings whith multiple devices.					</p>

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						My name is Connor Kutz and I am originally from Greensburg, Pennsylvania. I was excited to start this project because it deals a lot with audio and sound processing which I find very interesting. Additionally since it's an app, it was a good way to work on my mobile development skills. This July, I will be starting a new job as a Software Engineer working for Alarm.com on the Mobile team. Thanks for reading!
