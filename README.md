## What works, what doesnt work, what to be aware of

The crime hotspot identification system, the active crime alert system, and the active volume management all work. We are currently finalizing the noise dectionion system. We are still trying to find a reliable source for crime alerts, and the name recognition system has yet to be completed 

## Ideas for next steps

One idea is to add the name recognition system, which which could be easily implemented using Googleâ€™s Text-to-Speech service. Another option is making the system better for visually impaired users because of the application's heavy use of audio alerts.
